# Rapid Ambulance
An ambulance service web app that suggests the best path to a hospital considering the following five factors:
1) Distance
2) Crowd
3) Public / Government hospital
4) Availability of beds
5) Specialisation in the hospital

Technologies used:
1) HTML/CSS for front end
2) Django for back end
3) Computer vision for detecting crowd

Also, used Google MyMaps API for showing the location of nearby hospitals to the user.
